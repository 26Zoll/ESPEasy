Plugin is based on [Arduino library to control Mitsubishi Heat Pumps](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump).

Supported hardware
------------------

Plugin should support all Mitsubishi units with a CN105 connector:

* [P-Series](https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/2018-01_P-Series_Controls-Compatibility-Chart.pdf),
* [M-Series](https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/2018-01_M-Series_Controls-Compatibility-Chart.pdf),
* [CITY MULTI](https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/Controller_Compatibility_Chart_2017-12_CITY_MULTI.pdf)

There is also an open issue where users can report which models they are using - [list](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/issues/13).

Setup
------------------

The Mitsubishi Heatpump can be added as simple as selecting it from the list, selecting the serial port used for connection - and we are ready:

Once we hit submit, the plugin will start sending messages through controller, i.e. MQTT with payload:

`{"roomTemperature":23.0,"wideVane":"|","power":"OFF","mode":"AUTO","fan":"QUIET","vane":"AUTO","iSee":false,"temperature":24.0}`

Message is send every time a change is detected (i.e. one changes settings using IR remote control) and every X seconds, as set in the settings (60 seconds in above screenshot).

Sample setup for openHAB can be found [here](https://community.openhab.org/t/mitsubishi-heat-pump/91765).
